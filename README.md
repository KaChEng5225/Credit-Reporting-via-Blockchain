# Credit-Reporting-via-Blockchain
I desire to build a dApp on the Neo Blockchain that would keep track and confirm credit reporting. This can then be used for cash flow purposes in the Neo Smart Economy. 

As time goes on, wallets such as the Neon Wallet will have a very deep tranaction history. If a wallet address is willing, their history can be analyzed and an initial estimate of credit worthiness can be generated. Any event when Gas is borrowed will be recorded on the blockchain. This will allow two types of credit reports: Debtors and Lendors. A Debtor report will show where a wallet address has borrowed Gas, and display time stamed payments to the Lendor. The time stamp will be done by block, which can be converted to a date and time. The Lendors report will show where an address has distributed assets, and will display their contribution to the economy.

By generating these two reports, a new type of credit score can be created. Blockchain technology allows for this becuase when a general public consensus agrees that the information is correct, those transactions are on the blockchain and can be viewed by anyone. In this case, this information can be used for determining the time value of money (interest rate) for a loan. 

The most exciting part of this idea is the fact that a person would have access to funds witin minutes, and those funds would come from any person in the Neo Smart Economy willing to loan it out to earn interest instead of from a corporate bank. The two parties would be incentivized to play fair due to the generation of the credit report. Great lendors/debtors will recieve great interest rates while people who are late on payments will recieve higher interest rates, all of which will be detrmined via Smart Contract. Another great result of this is that the interest rate will determined by a pure free market instead of by the large corporate banks. A transaction will not occur unless both parties are satisfied and the Smart Contract is enacted.
